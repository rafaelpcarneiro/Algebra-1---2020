# Algebra 1 - 2020 (pt)

Here I will maintain my solutions on some exercises of theory of modules.
Also I'll be trying to keep here some notes on the subject. 


The books used on my studies are:
* Anéis e Módulos, by Polcino;
* Algebra - 3rd edition, by Birkhoff and MacLane.

(Basically, here is just a place in which I can organize better my work. Also, I can
avoid loosing the pdfs when storing here instead of keeping them
on my laptop...)
